# The HINT Performance Analyzer â€“ 64-Bit Port

This is a 64-bit port of the [HINT (Hierarchical INTegration) benchmark][1], originally developed at the Ames Laboratory at the U.S. Department of Energy. It has been modified to take full advantage of modern 64-bit computer systems. This benchmark is unique in that it is designed as a holistic assessment of system performance, including the CPU, caches, main memory, and storage.

More details can be found in the original README.txt file inside the "serial" directory. This file will be updated with more technical information as the project progresses.
