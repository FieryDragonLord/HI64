# The HINT Performance Analyzer â€“ 64-Bit Port

This is a 64-bit port of the [HINT (Hierarchical INTegration) benchmark][1], originally developed at the Ames Laboratory at the U.S. Department of Energy. It has been modified to take full advantage of modern 64-bit computer systems. This benchmark is unique in that it is designed as a holistic assessment of system performance, including the CPU, caches, main memory, and storage.

## How it works

HINT assesses system performance by computing the upper and lower bounds of the function `(1/x)/(1+x)` within the interval [0, 1] by dividing the region into many subintervals, using only the fact that the function is always decreasing. The program stores the data for each subinterval in an array called `rect`. The error of this computation is determined by summing for each interval the difference between the upper and lower bounds multiplied by the width of the interval. The reciprocal of the error represents the precision of the computation, referred to as **quality**.

The benchmark consists of a series of trials, each of which consists of a number of runs of the above computation using a certain number of subintervals. Each subsequent trial uses more subintervals, increasing the precision of the result along with the amount of CPU time and memory required. For each trial, HINT keeps track of the amount of time and memory required to complete the computation, as well as the quality of the result and other information. Based on this information, a value called **quality improvements per second** (**QUIPS**) is computed, representing the computer's performance for that trial. The QUIPS attained by a computer over time as the benchmark progresses can be used for in-depth assessment of the performance characteristics of the system.

The benchmark runs continuously until a substantial drop in performance occurs. This typically occurs when the computer runs out of main memory and resorts to disk paging to complete the computation, resulting in a dramatic slowdown and an attendant drop in QUIPS. Specifically, the benchmark stops when the QUIPS for the previous trial drops belows a predefined ratio of the peak QUIPS attained during the benchmark or when the slowest run in a trial takes longer than a predefined amount of time. (More details on how to set these limits follow.)

## Configuration

Settings for HINT are defined at build time, through a combination of compiler options and macros defined in `hint.h`.

*TODO*: Add configuration information for each item 

## Interpreting output

*TODO*

## More information

More details can be found in the original README.txt file inside the "serial" directory. This file will be updated with more technical information as the project progresses.
